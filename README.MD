Java program that stores a sorted list of strings (for example, names) in a file.  
At program start up, read in any strings that are currently in your data file (on the first iteration of the program there will be none) 
and places them into an array or ArrayList


Provides a menu that allows the user to enter additional strings, determine whether a particular string is present in the list, 
and edit the strings in the list.  

At termination, the program should write the new sorted list back to your data file.
